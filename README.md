# Black Screen

A super simple website that displays a pure black screen.  

## Why?
Sometimes when I am playing a game, or watching something, I find my second monitor distracting. I wanted a way to "turn off" my monitor while still keeping functionality if I need it temporarily.
My previous solution was to load a YouTube video of a black screen, but this uses network bandwidth. So I have created a black screen webpage as a lightweight way to keep my monitor dark using just a browser tab.

## Features
- Single `index.html` file
- Fills the entire browser window with black
- No extra scripts, no external dependencies
- Works on any modern browser
- Perfect for covering a secondary monitor without turning it off

## How to Use
1. Open the [GitHub Pages link](https://keemcc.github.io/black-screen/).
2. Drag the tab to the monitor you want to keep dark.
3. Maximize the browser window.
4. Done - now you have a black screen.

## Local Setup
If you want to run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/black-screen.git
cd black-screen
open index.html  # or double-click it
